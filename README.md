# Analytical-Programming
- sometimes jupiter notebooks do not load in github, to view any of the python files, copy the link of the file and use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to view it

- HW1 includes programs that clean and organize data from html and text files. I use skills like regular expressions and dictionaries to create a TF-IDF function.

- HW2 includes programs that deal with pandas functions and methods

- HW3 includes data from a paper by Ipeirotis et al. available here. This details an experiment run on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing system. They ask a bunch of raters (called “turks”) to rate several urls, but they already know the answers (the true categories) for a few urls, called the “gold set”. The ratings of the turks on the gold set thus allows us to judge their accuracy.
